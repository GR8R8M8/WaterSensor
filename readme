This water sensor is meant for the NodeMCU, and requires the Thingspeak library and the ESP8266 library, along with the NodeMCU added to your board manager.

--------

Parts:

1. NodeMCU (https://goo.gl/t6S5Kb)
2. RGB LED (https://goo.gl/J7y9jZ)
3. Soil Water Sensor (https://goo.gl/ZM8ECY)

----------

Wiring:

1. Connect the blue wire of the water sensor to the A0 pin
2. Connect the black wire of the water sensor to the GND pin
3. Connect the red wire to the 3v3 pin
4. Connect the green pin of the RGB LED to D0
5. Connect the red pin of the RGB LED to D1
6. Connect the ground pin of the RGB LED to GND

Dependancy Installation:

Installing The NodeMCU into the board manager:
(File > Preferences > Paste "https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases/download/2.1.0/package_esp8266com_index.json")
then go to
(Tools > Board > Board Manager > Type in "NodeMCU" > Click Install)

Installing the ESP8266 Library:
(Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries > Type in "ESP8266" > Click Install)

Installing the Thingspeak library:
(Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries > Type in "Thingspeak" > Click Install)

----------

Setup:

1. Change waterThreshold value to a value that fits your application 
    Water threshold values for the DFROBOT sensor I am using are as follows:
      0-300       Dry Soil
      300-700     Damp Soil
      700-950     In Water

2. Change the SSID and password to your WiFi network's 
3. Change the Thingspeak channel number and API key to your own
4. Click upload
